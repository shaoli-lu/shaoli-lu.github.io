    <h2>Welcome To My Site!</h2>
    <p>Richard Nixon once said: “The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word crisis (危机). One brush stroke 危 stands for danger; 
      the other 机 for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger - but recognize the opportunity.” This quote is apt for this COVID-19 pandemic.  
      The virus is very contagious that is the danger 危 part. There is also the opportunity 机 part. As the virus keeps us in a shelter-in / stay-at-home 
      state, we have more time for some "home" projects! For me, I have time to learn and build some web apps of my own that are ad-free. I've built a few. They are varied in 
      functionalities and contents. I highlight a few on this page. There are apps I built for my developer needs and for my kids to preserve 
      fond family memories. I tried to make the apps mobile friendly. To add web apps to the home screen for quick access, follow 
      instruction <a href="https://natomasunified.org/kb/add-website-to-mobile-device-home-screen/">here</a>. Without further ado, let's dive in!</p>
