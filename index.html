    <h2>Welcome To My Site!</h2>
    <p>Richard Nixon once said: “The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word crisis (危机). One brush stroke 危 stands for danger; 
      the other 机 for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger - but recognize the opportunity.” This quote is apt for this COVID-19 pandemic.  
      The virus is very contagious that is the danger 危 part. There is also the opportunity 机 part. As the virus keeps us in a shelter-in / stay-at-home 
      state, we have more time for some "home" projects! For me, I have time to learn and build some web apps of my own that are ad-free. I've built a few. They are varied in 
      functionalities and contents. I highlight a few on this page. There are apps I built for my personal and developer needs. I tried to make the apps mobile device friendly. To add web apps to the home screen on a phone for quick access, follow 
      instruction <a href="https://natomasunified.org/kb/add-website-to-mobile-device-home-screen/">here</a>. Without further ado, let's dive in!</p>

      <p><br>
        Memory match is a classic brain training game that helps improve memory and concentration skills. To play the game, you need to click or use the number key to reveal two cells at a time. If the numbers in the two cells match, they will remain visible. If they do not match, the cells will be hidden again. The goal of the game is to find all the matching pairs in the shortest amount of time.
