    <h2>Welcome To My Site!</h2>
    <p>
      As Richard Nixon once said, "The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word crisis (危机). One brush stroke, 危, stands for danger; the other, 机, stands for opportunity". This quote is particularly apt for the current COVID-19 pandemic. While the virus is highly contagious and poses a significant danger, it has also created opportunities for people to focus on projects and activities they may not have had time for before. During this shelter-in-place/stay-at-home period, I have been working on building websites for my own personal use. I have developed a number of sites that serve different purposes and contain a variety of content, such as 
      <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/country/">Flag Finder - WorldStats</a>,
      <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/HelloPuppy/">dog slideshows</a>,  
      <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/DadJokes/">dad jokes</a>,  
      <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/Christmas/">music playlists</a>,  
      <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/trivia1/">trivia quiz</a>, 
      <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/MathFun2/">math fun</a>, 
      <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/MemoryMatch/">memory training</a>,  
      <!-- <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/Currency/">the value of a US dollar</a>,   -->
      <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/ToDo/">to-do notepad</a>   
       
     
       and more. Some are for <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/Portfolio/">my personal use</a>, while others are for <a href="https://shaoli-lu.github.io/UnderConstruction/">developers</a>. I have also made an effort to ensure that these sites are friendly to mobile devices. I encourage you to add them to your home screen as a web application for quick access on your mobile phone - you can find instructions on how to do this <a href="https://natomasunified.org/kb/add-website-to-mobile-device-home-screen/">here</a>. Without further ado, I invite you to explore the web applications I have built and see what they have to offer.

      <p><br>
        Memory match is a classic brain training game that helps improve memory and concentration skills. To play the game, you need to click or use the number key to reveal two cells at a time. If the numbers in the two cells match, they will remain visible. If they do not match, the cells will be hidden again. The goal of the game is to find all the matching pairs in the shortest amount of time.
